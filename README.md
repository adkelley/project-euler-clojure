# My solutions to the Project Euler problems written in Clojure

**See** [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) for background

## Steps:
1. Ensure that you have [clojure](https://clojure.org) and [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed

2. Install, build and run the problems:
```sh
lein run
```

If you want to run the tests:
```sh
lein test
```

**Note:** Some of the solutions to the problems take 15 seconds or more, so be patient!
